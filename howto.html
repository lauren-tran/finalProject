         <h2>   Lemonade Mouth is a game with moving platforms. The character must jump from platform to platform without falling off. You can also collect coins to buy new characters in the store. The coins also play a major role in your score because each coin you collect adds 10 points to your score.The instructions are fairly simple: press the left cursor to move left, the right cursor to move right, and the up arrow to jump up.
